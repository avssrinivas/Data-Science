    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a specific way to make it easy to manage, access, and update. Databases are used in many applications and industries, including web development, finance, healthcare, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational). Here are the key differences between these two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Relational) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases store data in tables with predefined columns and data types. The relationship between tables is defined using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases have a fixed schema, which defines the structure of the database and the relationships between tables. Any changes to the schema require modifying the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries: SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) to retrieve and manipulate data. SQL queries are usually written in a declarative style and are optimized for complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Compliance: SQL databases are typically ACID-compliant, meaning they ensure Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: NoSQL databases store data in various formats, including key-value pairs, documents, graphs, and column-family stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: NoSQL databases are schema-less, meaning the structure of the database can be changed without modifying the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries: NoSQL databases use different query languages or APIs for retrieving and manipulating data, depending on the type of database. These queries can be more flexible than SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Compliance: NoSQL databases are usually not fully ACID-compliant. Instead, they often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency (the CAP theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases use a fixed schema, structured query language (SQL), and are typically ACID-compliant, while NoSQL databases are schema-less, use various query languages or APIs, and prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific needs of the application and the data being stored."

    "DROP TABLE users;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: Used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, to add a new column \"phone\" to the \"users\" table, we can use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: Used to delete all the data from an existing table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, to delete all the data from the \"users\" table we created above, we can use the following SQL statement:\n",
