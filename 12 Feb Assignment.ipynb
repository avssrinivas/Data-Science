    "In this example, the NegativeNumberException class is defined with a constructor that accepts a message parameter. The square_root function checks if the input number is negative, and if so, raises a NegativeNumberException with a message that says \"Cannot calculate square root of a negative number\". In the try block, the square_root function is called with user input as the argument, and the result is printed if no exception is raised. If a NegativeNumberException is raised, the except block catches the exception and prints the error message.\n",
